1)Performed Feature Engineering from dataset found online.

2)Optimized Linear, Lasso,Ridge  xgboost,gradient boosting and Random Forest Regressors.

3)Ridge Regressiuon gave the least mean absolute error hence chosen as base model.

4)Tuned hyperparameters of base model using Grid Seach CV.

5)Built a client facing API using flask
